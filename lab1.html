    One Piece is my favourite anime of all time, and no matter What anime are going to be produced, i dont see them taking that top spot from One Piece. First of all, my favourite thing about it is the story. Having 1000+ episodes, the scale of the story is huge, and nothing feels rushed. Everything is planned and forshadowed in advance, and there are no plot holes in it. Even though it seems rather simple on paper, a boy wanting to become pirate king, it is much more and complex than that. Alongside the happiness and comedy and likeable characters, there are plenty of dark themes, referencing our world, such as slavery, drugs, experiments on children, tirany, the corrupt government etc. In the world of One Piece, we often see some pirates do more good than some marines, portraying perfectly the question of what is right and what is wrong. Also, everything is connected. If you think something is irrelevant at the beggining, chances are that 500 episodes later it will be explained in detail
